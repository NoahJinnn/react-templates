```

### Some code rule
+ Component that belong only to screen, should be placed on that screen's folder
+ App's state should using Recoil, state relate to API should using Redux
+ Function that can be used many time should place in utils or hooks if relate to state
+ HOC placed in components have prefix `HOC*` like `HOCAuthentication`
+ Layout placed in `layouts` and have prefix `Layout*` like `LayoutMain` or `LayoutDefault`
+ All atom from recoil should have prefix `atom*` like `atomDarkMode`
+ All config from configs folder should have export prefix `config*` like `configApp` or `configHomeScreen`
+ All redux slice should have prefix `action*` in action name like `actionGetHomeProduct` or `actionGetStats`

## Tech included
+ `NextJS + Typescript` Base source
+ `Redux Toolkit and Recoil` State managerment
+ `Storybook` Component helper
+ `Husky` Git helper
+ `SCSS modules` Style system
+ `Eslint and Stylelint` Rule of code
